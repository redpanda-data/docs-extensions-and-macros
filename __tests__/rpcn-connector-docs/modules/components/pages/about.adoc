Every Redpanda Connect pipeline has at least one xref:components:inputs/about.adoc[input], an optional xref:components:buffers/about.adoc[buffer], an xref:components:outputs/about.adoc[output] and any number of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors]:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  kafka:
    addresses: [ TODO ]
    topics: [ foo, bar ]
    consumer_group: foogroup

buffer:
  type: none

pipeline:
  processors:
  - mapping: |
      message = this
      meta.link_count = links.length()

output:
  aws_s3:
    bucket: TODO
    path: '${! meta("kafka_topic") }/${! json("message.id") }.json'
----

These are the main components within Redpanda Connect and they provide the majority of useful behavior.

== Observability components

ifndef::env-cloud[]
There are also the observability components: xref:components:http/about.adoc[http], xref:components:logger/about.adoc[logger], xref:components:metrics/about.adoc[metrics], and xref:components:tracers/about.adoc[tracing], which allow you to specify how Redpanda Connect exposes observability data.

[source,yaml]

http:
  address: 0.0.0.0:4195
  enabled: true
  debug_endpoints: false

logger:
  format: json
  level: WARN

metrics:
  statsd:
    address: localhost:8125
    flush_period: 100ms

tracer:
  jaeger:
    agent_address: localhost:6831

== Resource components

Finally, there are xref:components:caches/about.adoc[caches] and xref:components:rate_limits/about.adoc[rate limits]. These are components that are referenced by core components and can be shared.

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  http_client: # This is an input
    url: TODO
    rate_limit: foo_ratelimit # This is a reference to a rate limit

pipeline:
  processors:
    - cache: # This is a processor
        resource: baz_cache # This is a reference to a cache
        operator: add
        key: '${! json("id") }'
        value: "x"
    - mapping: root = if errored() { deleted() }

rate_limit_resources:
  - label: foo_ratelimit
    local:
      count: 500
      interval: 1s

cache_resources:
  - label: baz_cache
    memcached:
      addresses: [ localhost:11211 ]
----

It's also possible to configure inputs, outputs and processors as resources which allows them to be reused throughout a configuration with the xref:components:inputs/resource.adoc[`resource` input], xref:components:outputs/resource.adoc[`resource` output] and xref:components:processors/resource.adoc[`resource` processor] respectively.
