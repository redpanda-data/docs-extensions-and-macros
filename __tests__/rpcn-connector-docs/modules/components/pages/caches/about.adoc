= Caches
// tag::single-source[]

A cache is a key/value store which can be used by certain components for applications such as deduplication or data joins. Caches are configured as a named resource:

[source,yaml]
----
cache_resources:
  - label: foobar
    memcached:
      addresses:
        - localhost:11211
      default_ttl: 60s
----
____
It's possible to layer caches with read-through and write-through behavior using the xref:components:caches/multilevel.adoc[`multilevel` cache].
____

And then any components that use caches have a field `resource` that specifies the cache resource:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - cache:
        resource: foobar
        operator: add
        key: '${! json("message.id") }'
        value: "storeme"
    - mapping: root = if errored() { deleted() }
----

For the simple case where you wish to store messages in a cache as an output destination for your pipeline check out the xref:components:outputs/cache.adoc[`cache` output]. To see examples of more advanced uses of caches such as hydration and deduplication check out the xref:components:processors/cache.adoc[`cache` processor].
