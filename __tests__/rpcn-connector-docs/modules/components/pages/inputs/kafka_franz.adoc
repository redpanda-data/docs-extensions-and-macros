When you specify a consumer group in your configuration, this input consumes one or more topics and automatically balances the topic partitions across any other connected clients with the same consumer group. Otherwise, topics are consumed in their entirety or with explicit partitions.

This input often out-performs the traditional `kafka` input and provides more useful logs and error messages.

== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```text
- kafka_key
- kafka_topic
- kafka_partition
- kafka_offset
- kafka_timestamp_ms
- kafka_timestamp_unix
- kafka_tombstone_message
- All record headers
```

== Fields

A list of broker addresses to connect to in order. Use commas to separate multiple addresses in a single list item.

*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

seed_brokers:
  - localhost:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092
  - bar:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092,bar:9092
```

=== `client_id`

An identifier for the client connection.

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer
endif::[]

=== `tls.root_cas`

Specify a root certificate authority to use (optional). This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

include::components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

Specify the path to a root certificate authority file (optional). This is a file, often with a `.pem` extension, which contains a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate, specify values for either the `cert` and `key` fields, or `cert_file` and `key_file` fields.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

The plain text certificate to use.

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

*Type*: `array`

```yml
# Examples

sasl:
  - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    password: bar
    username: foo
```

=== `sasl[].mechanism`

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.2.0 or newer
endif::[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `metadata_max_age`

The maximum period of time after which metadata is refreshed.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5m`

=== `topics`

A list of topics to consume from. Use commas to separate multiple topics in a single element.

When a `consumer_group` is specified, partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic. Otherwise, all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, you can specify explicit partitions to consume by using a colon after the topic name. For example, `foo:0` would consume the partition `0` of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges. For example, `foo:0-10` would consume partitions `0` through to `10` inclusive.

It is also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition. For example, `foo:0:10` would consume the partition `0` of the topic `foo` starting from the offset `10`. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_from_oldest` determines which offset to start from.

*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

topics:
  - foo
  - bar

topics:
  - things.*

topics:
  - foo,bar

topics:
  - foo:0
  - bar:1
  - bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0,bar:1,bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0-5
```

=== `regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics should be interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. When topics are specified with explicit partitions this field must remain set to `false`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `rack_id`

A rack specifies where the client is physically located, and changes fetch requests to consume from the closest replica as opposed to the leader replica.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `instance_id`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, assign a unique value to `instance_id` to define the groupâs static membership, which can prevent unnecessary rebalances during reconnections. 

When you assign an instance ID, the client does not automatically leave the consumer group when it disconnects. To remove the client, you must use an external admin command on behalf of the instance ID.

*Type*: string

*Default* `""`

```yml
# Examples

instance_id: redpanda_input_5

instance_id: redpanda_input_6
```
=== `rebalance_timeout`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, `rebalance_timeout` sets a time limit for all consumer group members to complete their work and commit offsets after a rebalance has begun. The timeout excludes the time taken to detect a failed or late heartbeat, which indicates a rebalance is required.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `45s`

=== `session_timeout`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, `session_timeout` sets the maximum interval between heartbeats sent by a consumer group member to the broker. If a broker doesn't receive a heartbeat from a group member before the timeout expires, it removes the member from the consumer group and initiates a rebalance.

broker

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1m`

=== `heartbeat_interval`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, `heartbeat_interval` sets how frequently a consumer group member should send heartbeats to Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka uses heartbeats to make sure that a group member's session is active. 

You must set `heartbeat_interval` to less than one-third of `session_timeout`.

This field is equivalent to the Java `heartbeat.interval.ms` setting.

client

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `3s`

=== `start_from_oldest`

Whether to consume from the oldest available offset. Otherwise, messages are consumed from the latest offset. This setting is applied when creating a new consumer group or the saved offset no longer exists.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `fetch_max_bytes`

The maximum size of a message batch (in bytes) that a broker tries to send during a client fetch. If individual records exceed the `fetch_max_bytes` value, brokers will still send them.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `50MiB`

=== `fetch_max_wait`

The maximum period of time a broker can wait for a fetch response to reach the required minimum number of bytes (`fetch_min_bytes`).

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `fetch_min_bytes`

The minimum number of bytes that a broker tries to send during a fetch. This field is equivalent to the Java setting `fetch.min.bytes`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1B`

=== `fetch_max_partition_bytes`

The maximum number of bytes that are consumed from a single partition in a fetch request. This field is equivalent to the Java setting `fetch.max.partition.bytes`.

If a single batch is larger than the `fetch_max_partition_bytes` value, the batch is still sent so that the client can make progress. 

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1MiB`

=== `consumer_group`

An optional consumer group. When you specify this value: 

- The partitions of any topics, specified in the `topics` field, are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group
- Partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name

Consumer groups are not supported when you specify explicit partitions to consume from in the `topics` field.

*Type*: `string`


=== `checkpoint_limit`

The maximum number of messages that are processed in parallel inside the same partition before back pressure is applied. 

When a message with a specific offset is delivered to the output, the offset is only committed when all messages of previous offsets have also been delivered. This behavior ensures at-least-once delivery guarantees. However, in the event of crashes or server faults, it also increases the likelihood of duplicates. To decrease this risk, reduce the `checkpoint_limit` value.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1024`


=== `commit_period`

The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during shutdown.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`


=== `multi_header`

Decode headers into lists to allow the handling of multiple values with the same key.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `batching`

Configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy] that applies to individual topic partitions in order to batch messages together before flushing them for processing. Batching can be beneficial for performance as well as useful for windowed processing, and doing so this way preserves the ordering of topic partitions.


*Type*: `object`


```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
```

=== `batching.count`

The number of messages after which the batch is flushed. Set to `0` to disable count-based batching.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.byte_size`

The number of bytes at which the batch is flushed. Set to `0` to disable size-based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

The period after which an incomplete batch is flushed regardless of its size.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

period: 1s

period: 1m

period: 500ms
```

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

=== `batching.processors`

For aggregating and archiving message batches, you can add a list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. All resulting messages are flushed as a single batch even when you configure processors to split the batch into smaller batches.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array
```

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay rejected messages (negative acknowledgements) at the output level. If the cause of rejections persists, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`
