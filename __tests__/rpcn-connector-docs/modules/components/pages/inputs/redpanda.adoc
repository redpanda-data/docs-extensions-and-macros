== Consumer groups

When you specify a consumer group in your configuration, this input consumes one or more topics and automatically balances the topic partitions across any other connected clients with the same consumer group. Otherwise, topics are consumed in their entirety or with explicit partitions.

== Delivery guarantees

If you choose to use consumer groups, the offsets of records received by Redpanda Connect are committed automatically. In the event of restarts, this input uses the committed offsets to resume data consumption where it left off.

Redpanda Connect guarantees at-least-once delivery. Records are only confirmed as delivered when all downstream outputs that a record is routed to have also confirmed delivery.

== Ordering

To preserve the order of topic partitions:

* Records consumed from each partition are processed and delivered in the order that they are received
* Only one batch of records of a given partition is processed at a time

This approach means that although records from different partitions may be processed in parallel, records from the same partition are processed in sequential order.

=== Delivery errors

The order in which records are delivered may be disrupted by delivery errors and any error-handling mechanisms that start up. Redpanda Connect leans towards at-least-once delivery unless instructed otherwise, and this includes reattempting delivery of data when the ordering of that data is no longer guaranteed.

For example, a batch of records is sent to an output broker and only a subset of records are delivered. In this scenario, Redpanda Connect (by default) attempts to deliver the records that failed, even though these delivery failures may have been sent before records that were delivered successfully.

==== Use a fallback output

To prevent delivery errors from disrupting the order of records, you must specify a xref:components:outputs/fallback.adoc[`fallback`] output in your pipeline configuration. When adding a `fallback` output, it is good practice to set the `auto_retry_nacks` field to `false`. This also improves the throughput of your pipeline. 

For example, the following configuration includes a `fallback` output. If Redpanda Connect fails to write delivery errors to the `foo` topic, it then attempts to write them into a dead letter queue topic (`foo_dlq`), which is retried indefinitely as a way to apply back pressure.

```yaml
output:
  fallback:
    - redpanda_common:
        topic: foo
    - retry:
        output:
          redpanda_common:
            topic: foo_dlq
```
== Batching

Records are processed and delivered from each partition in the same batches as they are received from brokers. Batch sizes are dynamically sized in order to optimize throughput, but you can tune them further using the following configuration fields:

* `fetch_max_partition_bytes`
* `fetch_max_bytes`

You can break batches down further using the xref:components:processors/split.adoc[`split`] processor.

== Metrics

This input emits a `redpanda_lag` metric with `topic` and `partition` labels for each consumed topic. The metric records the number of produced messages that remain to be read from each topic/partition pair by the specified consumer group.

== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

- `kafka_key`
- `kafka_topic`
- `kafka_partition`
- `kafka_offset`
- `kafka_lag`
- `kafka_timestamp_ms`
- `kafka_timestamp_unix`
- `kafka_tombstone_message`

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5m`

=== `topics`

A list of topics to consume from. Use commas to separate multiple topics in a single element.

When a `consumer_group` is specified, partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic. Otherwise, all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, you can specify explicit partitions to consume by using a colon after the topic name. For example, `foo:0` would consume the partition `0` of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges. For example, `foo:0-10` would consume partitions `0` through to `10` inclusive.

It is also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition. For example, `foo:0:10` would consume the partition `0` of the topic `foo` starting from the offset `10`. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_from_oldest` determines which offset to start from.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

topics:
  - foo
  - bar

topics:
  - things.*

topics:
  - foo,bar

topics:
  - foo:0
  - bar:1
  - bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0,bar:1,bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0-5
```

=== `regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics are interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. When topics are specified with explicit partitions, this field must remain set to `false`.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `rack_id`

A rack specifies where the client is physically located, and changes fetch requests to consume from the closest replica as opposed to the leader replica.

*Type*: `string`

*Default* `""`

=== `instance_id`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, assign a unique value to `instance_id` to define the groupâ€™s static membership, which can prevent unnecessary rebalances during reconnections. 

When you assign an instance ID, the client does not automatically leave the consumer group when it disconnects. To remove the client, you must use an external admin command on behalf of the instance ID.

*Type*: string

*Default* `""`

```yml
# Examples

instance_id: redpanda_input_5

instance_id: redpanda_input_6
```
=== `rebalance_timeout`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, `rebalance_timeout` sets a time limit for all consumer group members to complete their work and commit offsets after a rebalance has begun. The timeout excludes the time taken to detect a failed or late heartbeat, which indicates a rebalance is required.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `45s`

=== `session_timeout`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, `session_timeout` sets the maximum interval between heartbeats sent by a consumer group member to the broker. If a broker doesn't receive a heartbeat from a group member before the timeout expires, it removes the member from the consumer group and initiates a rebalance.

broker

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1m`

=== `heartbeat_interval`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, `heartbeat_interval` sets how frequently a consumer group member should send heartbeats to Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka uses heartbeats to make sure that a group member's session is active. 

You must set `heartbeat_interval` to less than one-third of `session_timeout`.

This field is equivalent to the Java `heartbeat.interval.ms` setting.

client

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `3s`

=== `start_from_oldest`

Determines whether to consume from the oldest available offset. Otherwise, messages are consumed from the latest offset. This setting is applied when creating a new consumer group or the saved offset no longer exists.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `fetch_max_bytes`

The maximum number of bytes that a broker tries to send during a fetch.

If individual records are larger than the `fetch_max_bytes` value, brokers will still send them.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `50MiB`

=== `fetch_max_wait`

The maximum period of time a broker can wait for a fetch response to reach the required minimum number of bytes (`fetch_min_bytes`).

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `fetch_min_bytes`

The minimum number of bytes that a broker tries to send during a fetch. This field is equivalent to the Java setting `fetch.min.bytes`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1B`

=== `fetch_max_partition_bytes`

The maximum number of bytes that are consumed from a single partition in a fetch request. This field is equivalent to the Java setting `fetch.max.partition.bytes`.

If a single batch is larger than the `fetch_max_partition_bytes` value, the batch is still sent so that the client can make progress. 

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1MiB`

=== `consumer_group`

An optional consumer group. When this value is specified: 

- The partitions of any topics, specified in the `topics` field, are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group
- Partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name

Consumer groups are not supported when you specify explicit partitions to consume from in the `topics` field.

*Type*: `string`

=== `commit_period`

The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during shutdown.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `partition_buffer_bytes`

A buffer size (in bytes) for each consumed partition, which allows the internal queuing of records before they are flushed. Increasing this value may improve throughput but results in higher memory utilization. 

Each buffer can grow slightly beyond this value.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1MB`

=== `topic_lag_refresh_period`

The interval between refresh cycles. During each cycle, this input queries the Repanda Connect server to calculate the topic lag - the number of produced messages that remain to be read from each topic/partition pair by the specified consumer group.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level. If the cause of rejections is persistent, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams, as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`
