component_type_dropdown::[]

Executes a streaming or table query on https://docs.timeplus.com/[Timeplus Enterprise (Cloud or Self-Hosted)^] or the `timeplusd` component, and creates a structured message for each table row received.

If you execute a streaming query, this input runs until the query terminates. For table queries, it shuts down after all rows returned by the query are exhausted.
