component_type_dropdown::[]

Generates vector embeddings to represent a text string, using the https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings[Vertex AI API^].

# Configuration fields, showing default values

This processor sends text strings to the Vertex AI API, which generates vector embeddings for them. By default, the processor submits the entire payload of each message as a string, unless you use the `text` field to customize it.

== Fields

=== `project`

The ID of your Google Cloud project. 

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials_json`

Set your Google Service Account Credentials as JSON.

include::components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

=== `location`

The location of the Vertex AI large language model (LLM) that you want to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `us-central1`

=== `model`

The name of the LLM to use. For a full list of models, see the https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/model-garden[Vertex AI Model Garden].

*Type*: `string`

```yml
# Examples
model: text-embedding-004
model: text-multilingual-embedding-002
```
=== `task_type`

Use the following options to optimize embeddings that the model generates for specific use cases.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`

|===
| Option | Summary
| `CLASSIFICATION`
| Classify texts according to preset labels.
| `CLUSTERING`
| Cluster texts based on their similarities.
| `FACT_VERIFICATION`
| Optimize for queries that prove or disprove a fact, such as "apples grow underground".
| `QUESTION_ANSWERING`
| Optimize for proper questions, such as "Why is the sky blue?".
| `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`
| Optimize for document search, also known as a corpus.
| `RETRIEVAL_QUERY`
| Optimize for queries, such as "What is the best fish recipe?" or "best restaurant in Chicago".
| `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY`
| Optimize for text similarity.
|===

For more information about `task_type` options, see https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/task-types[Choose an embeddings task type^]

=== `text`

The text you want to generate vector embeddings for. By default, the processor submits the entire payload as a string.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`

=== `output_dimensions`

The maximum length of a generated vector embedding. If this value is set, generated embeddings are truncated to this size.

*Type*: `int`
