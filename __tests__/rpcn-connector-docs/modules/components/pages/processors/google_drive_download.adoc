Can download a file from Google Drive based on a file ID.
== Authentication
By default, this connector will use Google Application Default Credentials (ADC) to authenticate with Google APIs.

To use this mechanism locally, the following gcloud commands can be used:

	# Login for the application default credentials and add scopes for readonly drive access
	gcloud auth application-default login --scopes='openid,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly'
	# When logging in with a user account, you may need to set the quota project for the application default credentials
	gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project-id>

Otherwise if using a service account, you can create a JSON key for the service account and set it in the `credentials_json` field.
In order for a service account to access files in Google Drive either files need to be explicitly shared with the service account email, otherwise https://support.google.com/a/answer/162106[^domain wide delegation] can be used to share all files within a Google Workspace.
