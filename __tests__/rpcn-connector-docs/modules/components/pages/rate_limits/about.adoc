= Rate Limits
// tag::single-source[]

A rate limit is a strategy for limiting the usage of a shared resource across parallel components in a Redpanda Connect instance, or potentially across multiple instances. They are configured as a resource:

[source,yaml]
----
rate_limit_resources:
  - label: foobar
    local:
      count: 500
      interval: 1s
----

ifndef::env-cloud[]
And most components that hit external services have a field `rate_limit` for specifying a rate limit resource to use, identified by the `label` field. For example, if we wanted to use our `foobar` rate limit with an xref:components:inputs/http_client.adoc[`http_client`] input it would look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  http_client:
    url: TODO
    verb: GET
    rate_limit: foobar
----
endif::[]
ifdef::env-cloud[]

endif::[]

By using a rate limit in this way we can guarantee that our input will only poll our HTTP source at the rate of 500 requests per second.

Some components don't have a `rate_limit` field but we might still wish to throttle them by a rate limit, in which case we can use the xref:components:processors/rate_limit.adoc[`rate_limit` processor] that applies back pressure to a processing pipeline when the limit is reached. For example, if we wished to limit the consumption of lines of a xref:components:inputs/csv.adoc[`csv` file input] to a specified rate limit we can do that with the following:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  csv:
    paths:
      - ./foo.csv
  processors:
    - rate_limit:
        resource: foobar
----
