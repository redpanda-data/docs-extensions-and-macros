For most Redpanda Connect xref:components:inputs/about.adoc[inputs] the data consumed comes pre-partitioned into discrete messages which can be comfortably held and processed in memory. However, some inputs such as the xref:components:inputs/file.adoc[`file` input] often need to consume data that is large enough that it cannot be processed entirely within memory, and others such as the xref:components:inputs/socket.adoc[`socket` input] don't have a concept of consuming the data "entirely".

For such inputs it's necessary to define a mechanism by which the stream of source bytes can be chopped into smaller logical messages, processed and outputted as a continuous process whilst the stream is being read, as this dramatically reduces the memory usage of Redpanda Connect as a whole and results in a more fluid flow of data.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
The way in which we define this chopping mechanism is through scanners, configured as a field on each input that requires one. For example, if we wished to consume files line-by-line, which each individual line being processed as a discrete message, we could use the xref:components:scanners/lines.adoc[`lines` scanner] with our xref:components:inputs/file.adoc[`file` input]:

A scanner is a plugin similar to any other core Redpanda Connect component (inputs, processors, outputs, etc), which means it's possible to define your own scanners that can be utilized by inputs that need them.
