== Avro JSON format

This scanner creates documents formatted as https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/[Avro JSON^] when decoding with Avro schemas. In this format, the value of a union is encoded in JSON as follows:

- If the union's type is `null`, it is encoded as a JSON `null`.
- Otherwise, the union is encoded as a JSON object with one name/value pair. The `"name"` is the type's name and the `"value"` is the recursively encoded value. For Avro's named types (record, fixed or enum), the user-specified name is used. For other types, the type name is used.

For example, the union schema `["null","string","Transaction"]`, where `Transaction` is a record name, would encode:

- The `null` as a JSON `null`
- The string `"a"` as `{"string": "a"}`
- A `Transaction` instance as `{"Transaction": {...}}`, where `{...}` indicates the JSON encoding of a `Transaction` instance

Alternatively, you can create documents in https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull[standard/raw JSON format^] by setting the field <<raw_json,`raw_json`>> to `true`.

== Metadata

This scanner emits the following metadata for each message:

- The `@avro_schema` field: The canonical Avro schema.
- The `@avro_schema_fingerprint` field: The schema ID or fingerprint.


== Fields

=== `raw_json`

Whether messages should be decoded into normal JSON (JSON that meets the expectations of regular internet JSON) rather than https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/[Avro JSON^]. If `true`, the schema returned from the subject is decoded as https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull[standard JSON^] instead of as https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodec[Avro JSON^]. For more details on the difference between standard JSON and Avro JSON, see the https://github.com/linkedin/goavro/blob/5ec5a5ee7ec82e16e6e2b438d610e1cab2588393/union.go#L224-L249[comment in Goavro^] and the https://github.com/linkedin/goavro[underlying library used for Avro serialization^].
