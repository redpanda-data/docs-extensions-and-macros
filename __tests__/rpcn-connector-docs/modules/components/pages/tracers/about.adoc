= Tracers

// tag::single-source[]
A tracer type represents a destination for Redpanda Connect to send tracing events to such as https://www.jaegertracing.io/[Jaeger^].

When a tracer is configured all messages will be allocated a root span during ingestion that represents their journey through a Redpanda Connect pipeline. Many Redpanda Connect processors create spans, and so tracing is a great way to analyse the pathways of individual messages as they progress through a Redpanda Connect instance.

Some inputs, such as `http_server` and `http_client`, are capable of extracting a root span from the source of the message (HTTP headers). This is
a work in progress and should eventually expand so that all inputs have a way of doing so.

Other inputs, such as `kafka` can be configured to extract a root span by using the `extract_tracing_map` field.

A tracer config section looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
tracer:
  jaeger:
    agent_address: localhost:6831
    sampler_type: const
    sampler_param: 1
----

CAUTION: Although the configuration spec of this component is stable the format of spans, tags and logs created by Redpanda Connect is subject to change as it is tuned for improvement.
