= MCP Tool Costs
:description: Cost reference for Redpanda documentation MCP server tools

The typical cost range is $0.017 - $0.190 per operation.

Most operations cost between $0.03 - $0.08. Content review operations range from $0.017 (simple terminology checks) to $0.19 (comprehensive generated docs reviews).

== Cost factors

You control costs through:

* *Model selection*: Choose the appropriate model when starting Claude Code (Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for most work, Opus for complex reasoning)
* *Prompt caching*: The MCP server caches style guides and frequently-used content, reducing costs for repeated operations
* *Content size*: Larger documents and more comprehensive reviews increase costs proportionally

== How to measure costs

To track costs during testing:

. Run a single MCP tool operation.
. Use the `/cost` command to view accumulated costs.
. Record the cost for that operation.
. Restart Claude Code to reset costs for the next measurement.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
# In Claude Code CLI
> Get the latest Redpanda version
> /cost
----

The `/cost` command shows:

* Total cost for the session
* Duration (API time and wall time)
* Code changes made
* Usage breakdown by model (input/output tokens, cache usage)

=== API time and wall time

*API time (API duration)*:: The total time the Claude API spent actively processing and generating responses. This is what you're billed for.

*Wall time (wall clock time)*:: The total elapsed time from start to finish of your session. This includes API processing time, network latency, time between requests, and time spent reading/thinking.

For example:
----
Total duration (API):  52s
Total duration (wall): 3m 31s
----

In this case:

* API used 52 seconds of compute time (billable)
* The session took 3 minutes 31 seconds total (user experience)
* The 159-second difference includes network time, reading responses, and pauses between operations

== Choosing the right model

The model you use significantly affects costs. Start Claude Code with the appropriate model for your work:

[source,bash]
----
# Haiku - Fast and cheap (best for simple tasks)
claude --model haiku

# Sonnet - Balanced (default, good for most work)
claude --model sonnet

# Opus - Most capable (use for complex reasoning)
claude --model opus
----

=== Model recommendations by task

*Use Haiku for:*

* Generating documentation from structured data (properties, metrics, RPK commands)
* Simple content reviews focused on terminology or style
* Quick operations that don't require deep reasoning

*Use Sonnet for:*

* Comprehensive content reviews
* Working on complex documentation tasks
* Most day-to-day documentation work

*Use Opus for:*

* Extremely complex reasoning tasks
* Architectural decisions about documentation structure
* Currently not needed for most documentation tasks

== Cost optimization tips

* *Choose the right model*: Use Haiku for simple generation tasks, Sonnet for most work
* *Leverage caching*: The MCP server caches style guides and prompts - repeated operations in the same session are cheaper
* *Batch similar work*: Do multiple reviews or generations in one session to maximize cache benefits
* *Use focused reviews*: For content review, use `focus: "terminology"` or `focus: "style"` instead of `focus: "comprehensive"` when you only need specific feedback
