== Available templates

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Template |Use For

|`prompt-review-template.md`
|Creating review prompts for specific content types

|`prompt-write-template.md`
|Creating writing prompts that generate new content

|`resource-template.md`
|Creating reference resources (guides, checklists, templates)
|===

== How to use these templates

=== Quick start

. Copy the template you need
. Replace `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with your content
. Add YAML frontmatter (for prompts)
. Validate with `npx doc-tools validate-mcp`
. Restart Claude Code and test

=== Detailed steps

**Step 1: Choose a template**

Pick the template that matches what you're creating:
- Review prompts → `prompt-review-template.md`
- Writing prompts → `prompt-write-template.md`
- Resources → `resource-template.md`

**Step 2: Copy and rename**

[source,bash]
----
# For a prompt
cp mcp/templates/prompt-review-template.md mcp/prompts/review-api-docs.md

# For a resource
cp mcp/templates/resource-template.md mcp/team-standards/api-guide.md
----

**Step 3: Add frontmatter (prompts only)**

Prompts need YAML frontmatter at the top. The templates include placeholder frontmatter - customize it:

[source,yaml]
----
---
description: "Your prompt description"
version: "1.0.0"
arguments:
  content:
    description: "The content to process"
    required: true
---
----

**Step 4: Customize the content**

Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with your specific content:

- `[CONTENT-TYPE]` → "API documentation", "troubleshooting guide", etc.
- `[First thing to check]` → Specific checks for your use case
- `[Section names]` → Appropriate section names

**Step 5: Validate**

Check your prompt or resource for errors:

[source,bash]
----
npx doc-tools validate-mcp
----

**Step 6: Test**

Restart Claude Code and test your new prompt or resource.

No code editing required - the MCP server auto-discovers files in `mcp/prompts/` and `mcp/team-standards/`!

== Customization tips

=== For review prompts

Focus on:
- **Specific checks** relevant to the content type
- **Common mistakes** you see in reviews
- **Required elements** that must be present
- **Output format** that's easy to act on

Good checklist items:
- Concrete and testable
- Focused on one aspect
- Clear about what success looks like

=== For writing prompts

Focus on:
- **Clear structure** that matches your templates
- **Specific requirements** for the content type
- **Quality standards** that must be met
- **Examples** showing what good looks like

Good requirements:
- Specific and actionable
- Based on real patterns
- Include rationale

=== For resources

Focus on:
- **Practical examples** showing how to apply rules
- **Good vs bad** comparisons
- **Checklists** for quick verification
- **Clear organization** that's easy to scan

Good resources:
- Scannable with clear headings
- More examples than rules
- Actionable guidance

== Examples

=== Example: Review prompt for API docs

[source,bash]
----
# Copy template
cp mcp/templates/prompt-review-template.md mcp/prompts/review-api-docs.md

# Edit and customize
vi mcp/prompts/review-api-docs.md
----

Key customizations:
- Replace `[CONTENT-TYPE]` with "API documentation"
- Add checks for: authentication section, request/response examples, error codes
- Add common issues: missing status codes, unclear parameter descriptions
- Define output format for API-specific feedback

=== Example: Resource for code examples

[source,bash]
----
# Copy template
cp mcp/templates/resource-template.md mcp/team-standards/code-examples-guide.md

# Edit and customize
vi mcp/team-standards/code-examples-guide.md
----

Key customizations:
- Add language-specific guidelines (bash, Python, YAML)
- Include examples of good vs bad code formatting
- Add checklist for code review
- Show proper use of code block roles

== Template placeholders reference

== Getting help

- See link:../WRITER_EXTENSION_GUIDE.adoc[Writer Extension Guide] for complete instructions
- Check existing prompts in `mcp/prompts/` for examples
- Review existing resources in `mcp/team-standards/` for patterns
- Ask your team lead for guidance

== Contributing

When you create a great prompt or resource:

. Add it to the examples in link:../WRITER_EXTENSION_GUIDE.adoc[Writer Extension Guide]
. Share it with the team
. Consider if it should become a new template

The more prompts and resources we build, the more consistent and efficient our docs team becomes!
